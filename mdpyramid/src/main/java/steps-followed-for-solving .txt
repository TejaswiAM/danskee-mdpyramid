MD Pyramid problem

Steps followed to get the solution:

1)	Read input from a text file and convert it into 2 dimensional array dynamically

2)	Construct Binary tree for each element of the last row of the array(Bottom-up approach)
a.	Construct Binary tree if and only if the traversal is possible like eve->odd->even->odd 

3)	Traverse each binary tree and store paths in integer array

4)	Calculate Sum for a path and store it in a TreeMap<Key,Value>
a.	Calculate sum for the paths if and only if paths size is same as no. of rows in our 2 dimensional array
b.	Where ‘key’ is sum and ‘value’ is integer array with the path from root to leaf node 


I would need little more time to come-up with efficient (time/space) solution and write Unit tests.
